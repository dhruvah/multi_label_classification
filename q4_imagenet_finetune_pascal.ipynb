    "As we have already seen, deep networks can sometimes be hard to optimize. Often times they heavily overfit on small training sets. Many approaches have been proposed to counter this, eg, [Krahenbuhl et al. (ICLRâ€™16)](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1511.06856.pdf), self-supervised learning, etc. However, the most effective approach remains pre-training the network on large, well-labeled supervised datasets such as ImageNet. \n",
    "\n",
    "While training on the full ImageNet data is beyond the scope of this assignment, people have already trained many popular/standard models and released them online. In this task, we will initialize a ResNet-18 model with pre-trained ImageNet weights (from `torchvision`), and finetune the network for PASCAL classification.\n",

    "## 4.1 Load Pre-trained Model (7 pts)\n",
    "Load the pre-trained weights up to the second last layer, and initialize last layer from scratch (the very last layer that outputs the classes).\n",
    "\n",
    "The model loading mechanism is based on names of the weights. It is easy to load pretrained models from `torchvision.models`, even when your model uses different names for weights. Please briefly explain how to load the weights correctly if the names do not match ([hint](https://discuss.pytorch.org/t/loading-weights-from-pretrained-model-with-different-module-names/11841)).\n",
